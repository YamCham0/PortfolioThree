        <h2>📜 About me</h2>
        <p>
          Since I was a kid I have always dreamt about working with computers.
            Passionate about everything I do and attentive to little details, so much that is annoying.
            Imaginary squirrels will attack me and I'm in constant war with my cat over the keyboard.<br />
            Would like to be employed by a company that will help me grow in within the industry.<br />
            In search of new knowledge and experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          Inventory specialist with a military background highly proficient in multiple IMSs (Inventory Management Systems).

Was trained by the military on how to polish my Leadership skills and how to use them in a day to day basis.

In this new adventure I'm here to learn, acquire experience but most importantly growth.

I would like to work in an environment that is safe and productive were communication is key and every single person is part of the team.

        <p>
          The following are projects and homeworks that I have worked on during my time in Bootcamp.
        I'm always trying to work on them in order to improve performance and user experience whenever I find the time.
        Any feedback is welcome to me and I find myself learning new ways and tricks on how to be a better version of myself.
